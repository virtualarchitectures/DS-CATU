This notebook prepares the Colab environment and runs the tool to download RTB determination orders.

NOTE: As of 24/11/2025 the Colab version is not working as intended due to challenges with the Selenium configuration. Possible fixes:

1. Test a package like Google Colab Selenium: https://github.com/jpjacobpadilla/Google-Colab-Selenium
2. Replace Selenium with Microsoft Playwright: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright

In the meantime it is recommended to run the program locally.
